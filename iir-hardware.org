#+TITLE: IIR Filters in Hardware
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil

* Generic
	- Generally used in lower samples rates, less than 200kHz.
	- Sometimes called /recursive filters/ because of the feedback
	- Advantages of a FIR filter:
		- Linear phase that is stable
		- Insensitivity to quantization effect
		- Ease of design
		- Do not suffer from limit cycle issues like filter oscillation
	- Advantages to an IIR Filter:
		- Better magnitude responses
		- Require fewer coefficients
		- Require less storage for variables
		- Lower latency
		- Tend to have outputs closer to analog models

* IIR Filter Structure
	Parts:
	- Forward FIR Filter (known as the all-zero filter)
		- Numerator: b coefficients for the zeros
	- Feedback FIR
		- Denominator: a coefficients for the poles
** Fixed-point Implementation
	 There are four items that will ensure good operation for fixed-pointed IIR
	 designs.
	 - Coefficient Quantization
	 - Internal Quantization
	 - Overflow
	 - Stability

** Direct Form 1 Structures
	 Check [[https://vhdlguru.blogspot.com/2011/01/what-is-pipelining-explanation-with.html][this]] for information on /pipelining/ in VHDL. It's great stuff!
	 - For the multiplications (and maybe the additions), use the /pipeline/
     method.
		 - Allows for a higher clock frequency
		 - Reduces synthesis times
		 - Increase throughput for the system

* Things to figure out
	- Arrays in VHDL
	- Limiting the bit widths
	- HOW TO DO DIS
