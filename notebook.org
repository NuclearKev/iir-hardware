	I started actually creating the VHDL file. I started by just placing the
	things that I believed needed to be there. The entity and architecture were
	built kinda.

	I found a [[https://github.com/tgingold/ghdl][program]] that will simulate VHDL. My entire design is screwed up!

	I basically worked out most of the kinks /except/ the arrays aren't happy.

	Attempting to fix these arrays...

	I fixed the arrays... They're even worse than I thought! Damn you VHDL... Damn
	you.

	Anyways, I'm ready to test my FIR design. Vivado! Oh Vivado, where art thou
	Vivado!?

	*IMPORTANT NOTE: GHDL seems to think certain pieces of "code" are incorrect*
  *when they seem perfectly fine. As of now, I'm assuming GHDL is making*
  *mistakes and will test it out in Vivado someday.*
